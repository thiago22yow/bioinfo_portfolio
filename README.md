# Thiago Mendonça's Portfolio

### Hello, world!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I'm Thiago Mendonça, a Biotechnologist with a Master's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, currently in the final stages of completing my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> My initial exposure to bioinformatics occurred during my undergraduate exchange program in Canada. The very first lesson was all about the Monte-Carlo Algorithm, followed by 5 hours of R prectice. It was a bit of a shock to me, so much math and computation! I was determined to avoid bioinformatics as much as possible. Until my Master's program, I had been exclusively involved in wet lab molecular biology techniques. However, my project in the Master's program required me to dig into transcriptomics, which meant 100% in silico work. To my surprise, I found myself developing an affinity for it. The endless possibilities and beautiful graphs were joy to my eyes. Now, I spend my time conducting detailed and in-depth computational analyses using programming languages such as Python, R, and Bash to perform various biological experiments and analyses. Take a quick look at it!
